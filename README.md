Some of the notebooks may not render soon enough, try reloading if you want to see the notebook right on this site. You can click on the icon "raw" and save the notebook to your desktop and use. 

 * [python-1](notebooks/python-1.ipynb) Using python as a calculator
 * [python-2](notebooks/python-2.ipynb) collections in python: list, tuple, dict, set
 * [python-3](notebooks/python-3.ipynb) loops, functions, maps, simple plots
 * [python-4](notebooks/python-4.ipynb) copies and pointers
 * [python-5](notebooks/python-5.ipynb) 2D visualization of data
 * [python-6](notebooks/python-6.ipynb) Arrays from numpy, fitting polynomials and user defined functions to data
 * [python-7](notebooks/python-7.ipynb) Binning of large arrays, Parametric plots, Linear Algebra, Array representation in memory and its role on speed of computation
 * [python-8](notebooks/python-8.ipynb) Working on csv file from the cloud
 * [python-9](notebooks/python-9.md) Saving the modified dataframe to a csv on google drive

## SageMath using Jupyter Notebook
Github may have limited rendering of these notebooks. You can click on the icon on top-right to view the notebook externally in nbviewer. If github does not render the notebook, try reloading. Alternatively download the raw file to your desktop and run it locally.
