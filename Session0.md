Lesson -- 0 : Getting access to a machine

April-June-2021 semester

You need to have regular access to a computer preferably with Ubuntu
20.04 LTS (focal) operating system installed on it. Here are different
possibilities.

1.  If you have a laptop with Ubuntu or anyother flavor of Linux on it,
    you are ready to go.
2.  If you have a Macbook, you don't have to make any change. Most of
    the linux commands have their equivalents in MacOS too. Obtain a
    mapping of the commands with help of internet and the teaching
    assistants and keep that handy. Make yourself comfortable with the
    terminal application in MacOS.
3.  If you have a laptop of your own, seek help from the teaching
    assistants or volunteers in ICME Lab (NAC 220 -- I will put you in
    touch with them) to get Ubuntu installed in dual boot configuration.
    Take back up of files before modifying partitions -- just in case.
4.  If your laptop has adequate RAM and CPU performance, you can install
    a hypervisor (such as Oracle VirtualBox or preferably VMWare
    workstation) and install Ubuntu 20.04 LTS as a virtual machine.
5.  If installation of dual boot is not possible, and your machine is
    Windows 10, you can get the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
    enabled. Most of the work should be possible within this shell that
    is basically Ubuntu Linux in console mode. As you might know, Ubuntu
    Shell is now an officially supported feature on Windows 10.
6.  If you have a laptop but are unable to get a Linux/Unix like
    environment on it working, at least get OpenSSH or PuTTY installed
    on it. Obtain a login to any of the Linux machines in the ICME lab
    with help from the teaching assistants. Login using OpenSSH/PuTTY to
    that machine and try your stuff.
7.  If you do not possess a laptop and are also unable to borrow it from
    a friend for this course, please consider taking one for hire.
8.  If you do not have any access to a laptop and your finances do not
    permit renting either, please reach me discretely. I will try and
    get you help.

Hands on experience is a must to learn the course contents. Please
invest your time and efforts to get the practical experience. It will
make a big difference to the way you approach a technical problem for
the rest of your career.
