# Languages to explore

  * [julia](https://julialang.org/) is an emerging language for fast computation, machine learning etc.,
  * [R](https://www.r-project.org) is a language of choice for statistical analysis and data sciences
  * [scilab](https://www.scilab.org) is a fully loaded language by itself.
  * [perl](https://www.perl.org) is good at string processing and lots of modules to use.
  
As you learn, you will see that there are a lot of alternative languages, packages and tools that can help you get your work done before going to commercial packages such as Matlab, Mathematica, Maple etc.,
