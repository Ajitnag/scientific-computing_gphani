# Bash scripts

Here are some examples of bash scripts and their funcationalities. Documentation is given as part of the scripts. 

[script00.sh](../scripts/script00.sh) illustrates the use of special variables in a shell script.

[script01.sh](../scripts/script01.sh) lists all the files in /bin which are of the file type "shell script".

[script02.sh](../scripts/script02.sh) illustrates the use of expansion to create list of names in a given pattern.

[script03.sh](../scripts/script03.sh) lists all the files in four different directories which are of the file type "shell script".

[script04.sh](../scripts/script04.sh) lists Fibonacci numbers below an integer given as command line argument.

[script05.sh](../scripts/script05.sh) uses gawk to find the sum of sizes of all files in a folder.

[script06.sh](../scripts/script06.sh) illustrates use of sed to replace a string.

[script07.sh](../scripts/script07.sh) illustrates the use of gawk for column swapping and simple arithmetic operations on a data file [t1-data.txt](../scripts/t1-data.txt). Download this datafile in the same folder as the shell script before trying it out.
