# Getting access to a machine

The preferred operating system for this course is [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal)](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

You need to have regular access to a computer with a linux operating system installed on it. Here are different possibilities.

1. If you have a laptop with Ubuntu or anyother flavor of Linux on it, you are ready to go.
2. If you have a Macbook, you don't have to make any change. Most of the linux commands have their equivalents in MacOS too. Obtain a mapping of the commands with help of internet and the teaching assistants and keep that handy. Make yourself comfortable with the terminal application in MacOS.
3.  If you have a laptop of your own, seek help from the teaching assistants or volunteers for the course to get Ubuntu installed in dual boot configuration. Take back up of files before modifying partitions -- just in case.
4.  If your laptop has adequate RAM and CPU performance, you can install a hypervisor such as [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or preferably [VMWare workstation](https://www.vmware.com/in/products/workstation-player.html) and install Ubuntu on it as a virtual machine.
5.  If installation of dual boot is not possible, and your machine is Windows 10, you can get the [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (Windows Subsystem for Linux) enabled. Most of the work should be possible within this shell that is basically Ubuntu Linux in console mode. As you might know, Ubuntu Shell is now an officially supported feature on Windows 10.
6.  If you have a laptop but are unable to get a Linux/Unix like environment on it working, at least get OpenSSH or PuTTY installed on it. Obtain a login to any of the Linux machines in the lab with help from the teaching assistants. Login using [OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) / [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) to that machine and try your commands.
7. You can also consider buying a [raspberry pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) and have [ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/raspberry-pi) installed on it. Ubuntu support for ARM is pretty good. 
8.  If you do not possess a laptop and are also unable to borrow it from a friend for this course, please consider taking one for hire.

Hands on experience is a must to learn the course contents. Please invest your time and efforts to get the practical experience. It will make a big difference to the way you approach a technical problem for the rest of your career.
