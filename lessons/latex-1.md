# LaTeX environment

## On Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

You can install the following packages to have the latex typsetting environment ready on your desktop.

      sudo apt-get install texlive texlive-basic texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-extra

If you have enough space, you can install ALL the texlive packages.

      sudo apt-get install texlive-full

You will need a nice editor to do syntax highlighting and help compile the document comfortably. TeXmaker is a good choice. If you are using the KDE as your graphical user environment, then kile is also a good choice.

      sudo apt-get install texmaker
      sudo apt-get install kile

You will also need a good viewer for ps and pdf files. Okular is a good choice. Evince is also a nice viewer.

      sudo apt-get install okular
      sudo apt-get install evince

## On the cloud

There is a nice cloud based platform to prepare latex documents. If you register with the email provided by your university then you can avail extra features that come with subscription. IIT Madras has done that for its students and faculty members so register with your email on smail.iitm.ac.in domain.
